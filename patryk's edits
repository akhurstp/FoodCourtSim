As of right now my code allows the user to create as many eateries and checkouts as they want

It will add people and randomly place them in an eatery and varys the time there at the eatery

Then they will be added to a checkout que which is STATIC between all checkouts so each checkout can pull from it

The one problem is the ques max size is 0 and I think it is because it diesnt delay for the check outs and just automatically pulls
im not quite sure on that one.
